    <<~EOS
      Homebrew has detected that Mercurial is configured to use a certificate
      bundle file as its trust store for TLS connections instead of using the
      default OpenSSL store. If you have trouble connecting to remote
      repositories, consider unsetting the `web.cacerts` property. You can
      determine where the property is being set by running:
        hg config --debug web.cacerts
    EOS

    system "#{bin}/hg", "init"
